# Pavlo Vanat

Solo developer focused on data engineering and machine learning for algorithmic system development.

I work primarily on high-throughput data pipelines, time-series processing, and ML-driven decision systems. My background includes backend and server-side engineering, with hands-on experience operating containerized infrastructure.

### Tech
- Python, Rust
- Data engineering & time-series systems
- Machine learning for algorithmic strategies
- Backend & infrastructure (Kubernetes)

### Current focus
- Algorithmic trading bots
- Real-time market data ingestion and processing
- Research & experimentation in ML-driven strategies

### Collaboration
If you’re interested in **training algo bots**, I can provide **polished, ML-ready datasets** inspired by methods from *Marcos López de Prado*, with extensive feature engineering and labeling pipelines.

Feature sets include trades, l2books, and volatility-derived signals (e.g. impact, intensity, bursts, exhaustion, VPIN-style metrics), applied consistently across multiple data dimensions — not limited to raw trades alone. Pipelines are designed for hyperparameter optimization over execution logic, depth dynamics, and feature interactions. (funding and open interest features coming soon)

Open to collaboration on technically challenging, research-driven projects.
